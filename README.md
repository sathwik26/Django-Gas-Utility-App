# Django-Gas-Utility-App
Case Study: Improving Customer Service for a Gas Utility Company through a Django Application

1. Introduction
A large gas utility company was experiencing operational inefficiencies as a result of a large number of customer service requests. Their current system was not able to handle these requests efficiently, resulting in long wait times, bad service, and customer dissatisfaction. To overcome these issues, the company decided to create a Django-based web application to automate customer service operations.

2. Problem Statement
The business required an online solution that would:
    -Facilitate customers to send service requests online
    -Support real-time tracking of service requests
    -Enable a platform for customers to see account information
    -Help customer service representatives manage and resolve requests in an efficient manner

3. Solution: Django-Based Consumer Services Application
The Django application was intended to provide a user-friendly and effective means for customers to engage with the gas utility firm. The system featured the following main aspects:
    i)Customer Features:-Service Requests: Customers were able to place service requests via an online platform. The feature compromised: 
     Choice of request type (e.g., gas leak, meter installation, billing problem), In-depth description of the issue ,Ability to upload 
     pertinent files (images, documents, etc.)

    ii)Request Tracking: Customers would be able to track the status of their submitted requests, such as: Status of the request 
      (Pending, In Progress, Resolved) ,Date and time of submission , Expected resolution time ,Account Management: Customers would be 
      able to log in to see their account information , Access billing history and service records

4.Customer Service Representative Features:
    Request Management Dashboard:See all submitted requests , Assign requests to service teams ,Update request statuses
    Communication Tools: Send automated notifications to customers about their requests , Internal communication for service teams

Admin Panel Features:
   User Management: Customer and representative account management 
   Analytics & Reporting: Make reports on the times taken for request resolution

5. Django Application Codebase Structure
   To ensure maintainability and scalability, the application followed a modular Django project structure:

│
│── templates/            
│── static/                
│── media/                
│── docs/                 
│── db.sqlite3          

6.Implementation
    The application has been developed utilizing Django, the database being PostgreSQL for scalability as well as for efficiency.       
     Frontend was achieved through Django templates utilizing Bootstrap to create a responsive user interface.
    -Backend: Django, Django REST Framework
    -Frontend: Django templates, Bootstrap
    -Database: PostgreSQL
    -Hosting: Hosted on AWS

7. Results & Benefits
   After deploying the application, the company experienced improved performance:
   -Reduction in Service Request Resolution Time: The requests were processed 40% quicker with improved tracking and automated alerts.
   -Increased Customer Satisfaction: Customers saw less waiting time and improved communication.
   -Operational Efficiency: Customer service agents were able to process requests more efficiently, resulting in improved productivity.
   -Data-Driven Decision Making: The company was able to find frequent issues and enhance service approaches with the help of analytics.

8. Conclusion
    Through the use of Django to develop an end-to-end customer service application, the gas utility firm was able to enhance customer   
    experience, increase operational efficiency, and automate service management. The deployment showed how digital transformation could 
    solve actual business problems in the utility industry.
